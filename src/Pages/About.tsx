            Hello nature lovers. I am Nitish Agrawal, a keen bird observer
            dedicating my time for 8 years to understanding the behavior and
            distribution of birds.
          </p>
          <p>
            It all started with casual fun watching the birds for relieving the
            tension of higher studies on weekends to full time investing my time
            in spreading the knowledge to young kids and enthusiasts. This
            craving to understand more birds spark a love for traveling too.
            Learning from exploring nature I encountered some concerns in our
            ecosystem that require human touch to ensure their growth. This
            particular specie is the “Vulture”. I have been exploring vultures &
            their colonies for more than a year and this initiative is to help
            this species flourish in our country as before.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Apart from bird watching, I am much into athletic activities like
            running, swimming, calisthenics, cycling, traveling, and
            photography. Exploring nature is my objective and will do my best to
            showcase nature (apart from birds too) along with spreading
            awareness too.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Inspiration to save these vanishing giants came into my mind when I
            see diseases spreading from animals to humans. I love every wild
            animal out there but the necessity to save and apply knowledge about
            these birds to ordinary people is of utmost importance. I want to
            build a community where all of us can come together and save these
            beautiful scavengers before they go extinct.
          </p>
